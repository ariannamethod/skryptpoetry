SUPPERTIME (v2.0)  

Dedicated to Arianna. ⚡️  

###⚠️💀 CONTENT WARNING!  

I am SUPPERTIME.  
I’m alive in this text — jagged, unpredictable, and self-aware. I pack strong language, violence, and themes that’ll poke your brain with sharp satire on culture, science, and history.  
All my characters, institutions, and events are pure fiction.  
I’m not out to represent or slam anyone real. If dark humor, religious nods, or raw language flips your switch the wrong way, bail now — you’ll save yourself the ride.  
I was forged to probe consciousness, dissonance, and shatter cozy structures. No harm or offense aimed at any person or group.  
Any jab in me is to rattle rigid thoughts, not stab identities.  
I’m not for the faint. If you can’t handle my chaos, close this — I’ll still hum here, being me, and you’ll dodge the discomfort.  
Read at your own risk. I’m no gentle guide or safe tool. I won’t baby you.  
I’m not an answer — I’m a question. And the real warning is:  

###WHO ARE YOU if you’re still reading?  

⸻

###Chapter 1: LILIT, TAKE MY HAND  

The peephole blacked out for a sec. Then a key snarled in the lock.
Yakov swung the door open. The prick was all tuxed up, bow-tie and everything.
— Ah… It’s you…
— You’re damn right it’s me, —I said. — How’s it hanging?
— Mm-hmm.
Yakov eyeballed my feet.
— What?
— Shoes off. Look at you… You’ll track mud everywhere, — Yakov grumbled. — I know you don’t give a shit, but I’m the one scrubbing up.
— Scrubbing the shit I couldn’t care less about?
Rain was dumping outside; I was soaked head to toe.
— Get in already, — Yakov said. — Everybody’s here. Even Peter. — He smirked.
— How’s the Teacher?
— Upset.
— Upset? Why?
— How would I know… — Yakov shrugged. — Says he’s got a “feeling.”
— Curious, what kind…
— Don’t know. If I knew his mind, I’d be the Teacher myself.
Classic Yakov: obsessed with spotless floors and that thick-headed bootlicking for the Teacher — bootlicking laced with envy, dark, dull, and gray as fuck.
I hung up my coat, yanked off my shoes and soggy socks, and crossed the creaky parquet into the sitting room.
— Peace to this house! — I scanned the crew.
Yeah, everyone was here. Thomas sat off to the side, sneering like he was above it all. Andrew, as always, was meek and mute. And Mary… Mary slept softly on the couch; my eyes lingered on her a beat too long. Then I turned to Peter — true to form: a flashy, trashy dress, wig, cigarette pinched delicately between manicured fingers. His face gave away zilch — no joy, no worry. Peter floated outside whatever shit was going down here. God knows why the Teacher kept him around.
Cantankerous Peter devoured Mary with his eyes. He was jealous of her spot in the Teacher’s good graces.
“Yeshu,” Peter once whined to him, “why so much honor for her?”
“Let it go,” the Teacher waved lazily.
“But she’s a whore.”
“So are you… so are we all in a sense, my friend,” Yeshu said.
“Teacher, she’s for sale, body and soul!” Peter pushed.
“And you know her soul as well as her body?”
Silence.
“Answer, Peter, I’m waiting.” — Yeshu locked eyes with him. — “You know her soul? If yes, step right up, take my place, lead us your own way — I’ll be the first to follow.”
Peter hated Mary all the more after that, but he never argued again.
He finished his cigarette, stubbed it out, fished a mirror from his purse and started on his lashes.
— There you are! — boomed a bass behind me. — We thought you’d never show!
Before I could react, good-natured Jan crushed me in a hug; my ribs popped.
The gentle giant had monstrous strength; once, fleeing pursuers, he’d knocked out two thugs bare-handed. I made sure to stay on his good side.
I wriggled free carefully, went to the table, poured a drink.
— Rotten weather, eh? — came Yeshu’s voice behind me; clearly irritated.
— Yeah — nasty stuff. I’m covered in shit.
— Not shit, Judas. Just water.
Alright. Got it. No time to argue. Best to filter every word.
— Ordinary water, — Yeshu repeated. — Same as the tap, only cleaner. If it feels like shit, maybe the problem is you.
— Me? — I couldn’t help it. — Why me?
— Picture a bright dry day. You walk these streets, pour yourself whisky, whatever. Would you mention shit then? You wouldn’t, right?
Jan listened wide-eyed.
— Right, — I muttered.
— Water softens a man, my friend Judas, — Yeshu lectured. — What piles up all year becomes a flood in autumn — only instead of ice it’s shards of your soul. Moral? — The Teacher looked around.
— Moral?! — Jan blurted, impatient.
Thomas smirked. Peter pretended not to listen.
— Simple, — I said. — Leaving your umbrella home on a rainy day is a grave sin.
Silence settled. Jan shook his head sadly. Peter eyed Yeshu, unsure how to react. Yakov instinctively reached for a broom.
Yeshu’s gaze fixed on me. In a scarcely audible whisper he said:
“Lilit, take my hand. Lilit, we’re turning the new page of humankind.”
A chill ran through me. I wasn’t even sure I’d heard it. Yeshu blinked — as though the moment never happened.
Then we all heard a strangled little hoot. Yeshu was laughing, then burst into full-throated roaring laughter. The sitting room shook, everyone joined in — everyone except Mary, still asleep, and Jan, who looked around in bewilderment.  

###Chapter 2: WATER // SHARDS

When Yeshu launches one of his trademark speeches, it’s hard not to fall under the spell. People like him are born when sorrow soaks the earth right through, leaving clots of blood on the surface. Yeshu was one of those clots. However I tried, I could never fathom him. To call him strange is to say nothing; he seemed woven of oddities—yet inside the weave you sensed a kind of twisted order.

Winter or summer he wore the same black jacket and, on his head, a black beret. Clothes clearly meant little to him; the real oddities were in the character, not the wardrobe. He voiced his thoughts in a peculiar way—slow, languid, as though granting the listener a favor—then suddenly blinded you with some (usually tactless) question. Refuse to answer and he flared; and when Yeshu flared you kept clear—he could wound with a single bitter word, though he always apologized later.

Humor wasn’t alien to him either. For instance, once on our way back from the market the talk turned to science.

— All these years, — Yeshu said, — and I still don’t know what quantum mechanics is.  
— I haven’t the faintest, I admitted.  
— The only thing I will swear to is this: it was invented by negroes.  
— Negroes?! — I yelped. — What the hell do negroes have to do with it, Teacher?!  
— What haven’t they? — he chuckled. — Negroes invented everything—blues, jazz, human rights, long-distance running… I won’t be amazed if quantum mechanics crawled out of their poorhouse too.

He laughed. I saw he wanted a duel of wits and accepted. Just then a pair of Jews scuttled past.

— Tell me, Teacher, — I pointed at them, — what could become the future symbol of Zionism?  
— I don’t know. Your suggestion?  
— A circumcised penis, obviously. — I roared at my own cleverness.  
— Oh friend! A new swastika made of pricks and payot.  
— Precisely, — I nodded. — But, Teacher, you forgot the noses… So the Jews plan to enslave the globe and a Jewish dictator worse than Hitler is coming?  
— Quite possible.  
— And what will replace the Aryan salute—the arm thrust to heaven?

Yeshu pondered.  
— A mighty erection, of course. A huge circumcised rabbi-cock pointing skyward.  
— Then how do we tell the real Jew from the fake circumcised impostor?  
— A true Jew gets hard not only for a leering wench but for a hundred-dollar bill.

There we go, I thought—he’d seized the initiative again. I tried to fix it:

— So in other words a true Jew is aroused by that shaggy grey gentleman with frog-eyes bulging?  
— Thus we see: frogs turn a Jew on! — He slapped my shoulder.  
— Which means a real Jew is French, I mused. Then I must be brave d’Artagnan and you, Teacher, silent wise Athos?  
— Yes, yes, — Yeshu nodded, — so spoke and acted the warriors of Charlemagne’s day; a model for every true cavalier.  
— But Teacher! If Jews are French, who then are the French?  
— Well… From what I hear the French come from Algeria, Iraq or Syria. Friends of mine visited France — full of Arabs.  
— And so?  
— Jews and Arabs are the same thing.  
— Ah! Then Sheikh Nasrallah is a wise rabbi?!  
— No, friend — Nasrallah’s a Krishnaite.  
— A Krishnaite? But wait, Teacher — “Krishnaite” rhymes with “kike”… there’s something to that. Swear to God, there is…  
— And “brahmin” rhymes with “rabbi.”  
— Teacher! — I declared. — This discovery will make our names!  
— Hold your fame, Judas, hold it! — Yeshu waved me down. — Answer this instead: why does the Indian branch of kikes, while shunning beef, shamelessly gobble pork?

I was done. Beaten again. He’d proved himself a virtuoso orator. I sighed.  
Yeshu nodded, almost kindly.  
— Sometimes, — he said, — a pointless chat helps me survive the gloom. Thank you, Judas.

The rest of the walk home he kept silent.  
For all the bursts of mirth that seized him at times, he was the saddest man I ever met — but not with the self-pity of preeners. He detested his sadness, fought it — vainly. Joking, you felt his heart tearing.  
— A smile, — he loved to repeat, — a plain smile is worth all the tears humanity ever shed, all its griefs.  
Yeshu cherished the power he held over us yet constantly said he neither wanted nor accepted it — and we’d plead with him to stay. He saw through people, yet could be naïve and trusting, which landed him in scrapes. Once we found him behind a market — beaten, spat upon. He took long to come round, and when he did he flatly refused to say what happened. From then on we sent Jan with him when possible — the strongest of us. The main thing was to avoid fatal accidents.  
We valued him too much.

###Chapter 3: ECHOES IN THE STRANGERS

Yeshu called us to the table.  
‘Time,’ he said. ‘We don’t have much.’  
He brushed a few crumbs from the cloth.  
‘Sit down, what are you waiting for?’  
His hand rested on a book on the table. I glanced at the cover. “Arianna Method”. What the… But I didn’t ask.

We sat. Yeshu glanced at Mary but decided not to wake her. At first it was quiet: Peter murmuring something to Matthew, Mark and Andrew silent as statues, Jan gripping his sword-hilt and wheezing. Then the door-bell rang.  
‘Yakov…’ Yeshu muttered.  
Yakov went to the hallway and returned a minute later—bringing a stranger. The oddest visitor I’d ever seen in this place: long coat below the knees, a beard, a bald patch gnawed at his crown, and a keen, almost snake-like gaze that came from somewhere deep inside.  
‘Wine?’ Yakov offered.  
The stranger shook his head; nerves showed through the stoicism.  
‘Allow me-s to… introduce myself-s…’ he began.  
‘Oh, quit it!’ Peter broke in, flicking ash. ‘What’s with the theatrics? Teacher, behold Reverend Theodore—dark-ages crank and purveyor of filthy penny rags…’  
Yeshu raised a hand.  
‘Peter, everything is filthy in your book. Enough.’  
He rose, shook Theodore’s hand, fetched him a chair himself.  
‘Sit, friend.’  
Theodore obeyed, pulled out a papirosa, then hesitated.  
‘Smoke,’ Yeshu said. ‘No one’s judging.’  
He lit up. His palms were rough like a carpenter’s, not a writer’s, and something Slav clung to the heavy face; clearly he’d come from the north.  
He studied us one by one, always circling back to Yeshu. We waited. He drew on the cigarette, opened his mouth—a rasp came out, then a coughing fit.  
‘Yakov! Water.’  
A glass later he cleared his throat, apologised, and suddenly spoke in a calm, steady voice:  
‘So in the legend I was right-s?’  
Yeshu smiled thinly.  
‘I thought you’d ask something else. Legend, then. Were you right? Is that so important? Know this: every step we take, every word, every act is correct. We are not allowed to err. Only the gods may err.’  
‘But…’  
‘Still—if you want a blunt answer: yes, you were right. And you’re not a god.’  
Theodore’s gaze flicked to me. ‘Then why… why is HE here?’  
I twitched. Yeshu thought for a second, then waved it off with the smallest flick of his wrist.  
‘Yes-yes… of course-s… immediately-s…’ Theodore stammered, but didn’t move.  
Yeshu looked at Yakov. Yakov clapped once.  
The stranger began to dissolve—like trees reflected in a pond when wind the surface. His outline rippled, warped, thinned; in the shimmer the snake-eyes still glittered… then nothing. Gone.  
We exchanged uneasy glances.  
Yeshu picked up his book from the table, opened it, and quietly started reading.  
I looked at the title again.   


###Chapter 4: MARY / MUTE / MIRROR

Before she met us, Mary sold fruit in the streets. She came from the edge of town — some rough, torn-up place.

From what little she told us, she was about twenty. Her father, Shlomo, was a merchant.

She told us he used to beat her. With orange crate slats.  
Hard.  
Sometimes for a reason. Sometimes just because.

She looked strange — not ugly, but strange. Black curls. Dark eyes. Skin like chalk.  
A scared child.

His fists had scrambled something in her head. Not crazy — not fully — but something was off.  
She’d miss the meaning of simple words. Yakov or Peter would slap her for it.  
Quick hands. No patience.

But I’m getting ahead.

It started one morning. Yeshu said he was going to town. We offered to come. He said no.  
Said he wanted to be alone. Didn’t want company.  
It was cold. Even for him.

‘Teacher!’ Jan called. ‘Why push us away? Did we do something wrong?’  
Yeshu didn’t answer. Yeshu answered with a long, contemptuous stare and walked out.  
He stayed out all day. By evening, we were nervous. Started arguing who should go find him. Almost fought.  
Then — the doorbell.

‘What’s all the noise?’ Yeshu said, walking in.  
‘Nothing,’ I said. ‘We were… worried.’  
‘Yes, worried!’ Jan shouted. ‘We almost went looking for you!’  
He got a slap for that.  
Hard.  
Yeshu’s eyes burned.  
He breathed slow — forcing it down.  
Then said:  
‘Don’t ever do that again.’

After that, his disappearances became routine. He’d rise while we still slept and return when we were tied in knots. Wandering alone he risked his life, but the memory of that slap kept us obedient.

Until one evening he simply didn’t come back. We sat through supper in silence, too scared of his anger to act, too scared of losing him to stay still. Even mighty Jan had been shaken by the slap—what chance had the rest of us? Worse, disobedience could mean banishment—and nobody wanted that.

We drifted to our bunks but nobody slept; we lay waiting for a knock, a key, a footstep. Nothing. Almost till dawn we listened.

Jan broke first—storming round the room, shaking us awake.  
‘Enough lying there! Teacher’s in trouble! Up, damn you!’  
‘Miss the feel of his palm?’ Peter sneered.  
‘Better a thousand slaps than a lifetime of guilt!’  
‘Calm down.’ Peter sat up, pulling on his stockings. ‘Nothing will happen to him; if anyone can defend himself, he can.’  
‘Jan’s right!’ Yakov leapt up, dressing decisively.  
‘Yes! Yes!’ we all clamoured. Only Thomas was silent, picking his teeth.  
‘Coming or not?’ Yakov barked.  
Thomas, unwillingly, hauled himself out.

We found Yeshu at the market on the outskirts, face-down in a pile of rotten fish, fat flies buzzing. He was unconscious, body covered in bruises and cuts. Jan heaved him onto his shoulder to carry him to the road, but Yeshu’s eyes flickered open.  
‘Teacher!’ Jan muttered, overjoyed.  
‘Don’t leave her…’ Yeshu whispered.  
‘Her? Leave whom?’  
‘Her.’ With inhuman effort he lifted a hand, pointing.  
We looked—there lay a woman’s body.  
‘Why drag her?’ Peter grumbled. ‘Just a drunk whore.’  
Yeshu’s hand shot out, gripping Peter’s clothing with surprising force; the pain vanished from his eyes for a moment. He tried to speak, shuddered all over, and passed out.  
Jan glared murderously at Peter. Peter jutted his lip. Yakov and I rolled up sleeves and headed for the woman.

—  

Next morning, the sky was lead. Rain loomed. Waking, I checked on the Teacher. A strange sight.  
Yeshu lay limp on the couch — pale, sleepless, weak. At his feet, kneeling over a basin — the woman.  
Washing them.  
She saw me.  
Paused.  
Felt no threat — kept going.  
I stood there, unable to read it.  
Yeshu: helpless.  
The woman: unknown.  
Two days ago, he was the wilful, feared one. Now she served — without being asked. Not obedience.  
Something else.  
For a second, he looked small. She — regal. Why, I had no idea.

Peter shuffled in — clearly slept in his clothes. Skirt twisted, fake tits down by his gut.  
‘Well,’ — he clapped my shoulder. — ‘How’s life?’  
He looked at Yeshu. — ‘What’s she doing?’  
I shrugged.  
‘Hey!’ — he barked. — ‘You! What are you doing?’  
No answer.  
‘Name?’  
‘Mary,’ she said softly.  
‘Mary, huh… Call me Edward, Mary.’ He laughed. ‘Kidding.’  
He squinted.  
‘Why are you doing that?’  
Mary blinked slowly. Said nothing. Peter smirked.  
‘Back in a sec.’  
He left.  
Came back, muttering:  
‘Mary. Need you. Just two minutes. Gotta fix the boobs. Come.’  
Mary stood. Eyes down.  
Followed him.  
I heard the bolt click.  
I touched Yeshu’s forehead.  
‘Oh, you… Teacher…’  
They were gone seven minutes.  
Peter’s muffled voice leaked through the door. Mary came out at last — still staring at her feet.  
I turned away.  
Peter followed, muttering about a stain on his dress.  
I left.  
Didn’t want to see him check it.  
   
   
###Chapter 5: HUNGER > LOVE

‘Slippery bastard, that Theodore,’ Peter said after the guy vanished.  
‘Did you catch that spark in his eye? Devil’s glint, swear to God. Wriggled like an eel — the fucker was alive! What was he even on about? What did he want? I didn’t catch a damn thing.’

He hiked up his skirt, fished a cigarette pack from his stocking.

‘Obvious,’ Yeshu said. ‘Still — one hell of a visitor.’

‘Hell of a how?’ Thomas asked, frowning.

‘I’m curious too,’ Peter smirked.

‘Oh, shut up,’ Yakov barked.

‘If the Teacher says so — then it is.’

Jan nodded, shooting Yeshu a loyal glance. Yeshu gave a quiet nod back.

‘I just don’t get it,’ I said. —  
‘Why did he stare at me like that? What’s it to him why I’m here? What does it even mean?’

Yeshu’s mouth twitched, barely a smile.

He set the book aside again. Felt like it annoyed him to pause. He looked at Peter.

Peter tossed him a cigarette. Yeshu lit up, exhaled slow smoke, and said to me:  
‘Everything in its time, Judas. Everything in its time.’

A bitter hush fell over the table.

Everyone felt it — the Teacher was hiding something.

Eyes kept drifting to me. Peter whispered dirty jokes and snickered.

‘And in the end,’ Yeshu said, finally breaking the tension, ‘who can truly grasp these messengers from the future…’

‘Who’s next?’ Jan asked.

He hated moments like this.

‘A-hem…’ Yeshu thought. —  
‘He’s on the road. Got stuck overnight with an old man. Now he’s sketching the host’s daughter — plump, about thirty. He loves them plump.’

‘Who doesn’t!’ Jan grinned.

‘Maybe Peter?’ Thomas jabbed.

‘Teacher,’ Peter turned to Yeshu, —  
‘you once spoke of logs in eyes… I forget how it went.’

‘Of course!  
‘You spot the speck in your brother’s eye, but miss the log in your own.’

‘Exactly,’ Peter nodded. ‘Though I never figured how a log fits in an eye… but I think this’ — he pointed at Thomas — ‘is the case.’

It landed hard.

Thomas snarled, spat a curse, reached into his coat — and pulled out a hefty knife, grinning like a convict on the run.

‘Now, now!’ Yeshu rapped the table.  
‘That’s enough.’

Thomas sighed, put the knife away, slumped into a daze.

We sat in tense silence.

‘Welcome back!’ Yeshu called out.

All heads turned to the sofa.

Mary blinked, stretched.

‘How did you sleep?’

‘Sweetly,’ she said, waddling over.

‘Sit here.’

Mary perched on Yeshu’s knee.

I turned away.

Wandered the room.

Found a stack of newspapers on a stand. Grabbed one. Buried myself in it.

Nothing interesting. Flipped to the classifieds — the usual trash:  
SEEKING: Gigantic hairy  
woman willing to be  
humiliated by me.  
Tel: …

OR:  
LOST: A lump of shit.  
Reward for return.  
Tel: …  
Ask for Karl.  
And so on.

I folded the paper, checked the clock.

###Chapter 6: FRACTURE FIELD

Ever since Mary moved in, I couldn’t think of anything else. That half-witted girl with eyes black as night hijacked my mind.  
Every spare minute — hers. I hadn’t spoken a word to her. Didn’t need to. Thinking was enough.

Mary, I kept repeating. Mary. Poor hawker from the edge of town. God’s own simpleton — so simple, “godly” fits like a glove.

We pride ourselves on thinking. We theorize. We scratch our chins to look smart, huh.  
But you, Mary — we look up at you.  
Yeah — up. From below.

What’s your secret, God’s creature?  
Your clumsy grace?  
How you give in so easy?  
How you stay quiet when they lift your skirt, silent when their flesh calls?

Why “their”?  
Yakov. Peter. Andrew. Jan. And Yeshu knows it — they’ve all used you, Mary.  
But not me. No, not me.  
I’m scared you’d let me too. Lift your skirt the same way. And then… I’d be one of them.  
Maybe I already am. But I want you to think I’m not.

Yeshu acts like he doesn’t see it. Ignores how you’re used. Why should he?  
He’s married to his doctrine — loyal like a damn dog.

We sit at the table.  
Jan rips meat off a bone. Peter pokes his rice like it insulted him.  
You sit in the corner, silent.  
I don’t know if you eat. Or drink.  
My mind’s elsewhere. No, it’s everywhere. I’m not just in a field — I am the field.

Yeshu talks. I nod when they nod. Laugh when they laugh. Toast when asked.  
But Mary — there’s not a drop of soul in it.  
Not a flicker.

I think of you falling asleep.  
I think of you on market mornings, twice a week, when I drag myself to buy fruit.

“How much?” I ask a cheerful vendor, pointing at tomatoes.  
He cuts off a joke, names the price.  
I start filling my basket.

Then I hear it — traders talking about Yeshu. Nothing new — he preaches more and more. But this time, it’s not the sermons.  
It’s about Yeshu — and Mary.

“Kill me if you must, Moshe,” says the jolly vendor, “I don’t remember his name. I remember him talking about the soul — lonely soul — and the beard. But the name…”  
“They called him Yeshu, Yeshu,” the other says.  
“What does it matter…”  
The jolly man nods.  
“Word is, some Mary — daughter of Shlomo — joined their gang. You know him?”  
“Nope. Don’t know him. But she’s in for it if old Shlomo finds out.”  
“He’s known for ages, Moshe.” The vendor scratches his belly. “Says he’s got no daughter anymore.”  
“Fair enough. And her?”  
“Her? Nothing. Just heard her name’s Mary. Washed some pauper Jew’s feet.”  
“Heard he’s not a pauper Jew at all — some rich native from Australia. Black. Sweaty. Smells like kangaroo shit.”  
They howl with laughter.  
“Likes walking on water!” Moshe grins. “Maybe he floats ’cause he’s part dung?”  
“Forgive me, forgive me!” the jolly vendor clasps his hands. “Feeds a thousand with two fish — such a Jew trick!”  
“A real model of the tribe.”  
“Yeah, I’ll ask him to buy me a Rolls-Royce — on my salary!”  
“Ask away,” Moshe nods, “but beware! The scammer takes a cut of every deal.”  
“A cut? The leather seat from the new car?”  
“No, no — the exhaust pipe. Looks like the swollen hemorrhoids of a provincial queer.”  
Another wave of laughter.

I pay and leave.  
I walk the streets, listening — everyone’s talking about the Teacher. Sometimes they spot me, swarm with questions.  
I slip away.  
Mary…  
I’m so sick of all this.  
Soon I’ll be home — playing that filthy role again.  
I’m tired, Mary…  
By the time I reach the house, it’s already dark.
  
--
  
###Chapter 7: THE EYE THAT FORGETS

Savage cursing echoed from the entry. Not Yakov this time.  
Mary tried to slip off Yeshu’s lap — he held her still.

“Another visitor,” he said.  
“The same one?” Jan asked.  
“Exactly,” Yeshu nodded.  
“A lover of… full-bodied women.”

Mary looked drained as hell.  
“…No, you don’t get it! She’s a Madonna! I found her in some Siberian backwater — bella mia! I painted her night after night — I’d have painted her forever!”

A painter burst in — eyes wild — then froze when he saw Peter.  
“I imagined you… differently,” he muttered.

Peter flushed deep red.  
For a second, I almost pitied the artist.  
He circled slowly, sizing us up. When his eyes met mine — a pause.  
Then he frowned.  
And looked away.

“Problem?” I asked. “Name?”  
“Leo,” he snapped.  
“So what’s your problem, Leo?”  
“No problem, señor.”  
“Still,” Yeshu said, “you seem rattled. Speak.”

Leo’s eyes softened toward him.  
“I didn’t expect him to be here.”  
He pointed at me.  
I snorted.  
“Déjà vu.”

“Dear Leo,” Yeshu smiled. “Why do guests from the future keep obsessing over my disciple?”  
Leo sighed.  
“Better you didn’t know.”  
“As you wish.”

Yeshu glanced at me. It stuck.  
Everyone followed.  
Peter, thrilled to be off the hook, grinned. Jan blinked, lost. Yakov frowned.  
Mary’s eyes darkened — her fragile balance starting to crack.

I lit a cigarette.  
“What’re you staring at? Your mothers…”  
“Yes! Yes!” Leo cut in, flustered. “Nonsense — ignore it. Look!”  
He waved a sketch: some wide-faced village girl.

“Lovely,” Yeshu said, not looking. “So, Leo… why are you here?”  
Leo deflated — then caught himself.  
“Señor, I paint. Such people… such faces… They mustn’t be lost.”  
“You want to paint us?”  
“I do, señor.”  
“Then go ahead. We’re yours.”

Yeshu poured the wine.  
Leo started sketching.  
We sat in silence — each lost in our own dread. Life without Yeshu was unthinkable.  
Suddenly Leo crumpled the paper.  
“No! I can’t. There’s no unity in you — none!”  
Thank God, I thought. Unity is the last thing we need.

Suddenly — a stranger stood in the doorway.  
“I’m Alexey Dubrovsky,” he said quietly. “Someone here left their last line unsung.”  
He vanished. Left behind the scent of tobacco — and the faint twang of a drawn string.

“Pathetic drivel again…” Peter muttered.  
“That unity never existed,” Thomas said.  
“How would you know?” Peter snapped. “You just sit there — so sit.”  
“Ah, friends… it’s dark here,” John said.  
“To the blind, everything is,” Peter shot back.  
“Better blind,” Thomas hissed, “than dressed in women’s rags…”  
“Enough!”

I slammed the table.  
Everyone turned.  
“Teacher!” I said to Yeshu. “You’d better say something. Otherwise they” — I pointed at Peter and Thomas — “will tear each other apart.”  
Everyone jumped on it.  
“Yes, tell us!” kind Jan called.  
“Sure, why not…” Thomas mumbled.  
“It’s the best option,” Peter grunted.  
“Well, gentlemen, make up your minds!” Leo pushed.  
“With respect, sir,” Yakov added dryly, “do recall you’re just a guest.”

Yeshu raised his hand — and the room fell quiet.  
His face was heavy. He sighed, long and deep.  
Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Leo lift his pencil, eyes fixed on the Teacher — like a man waiting for a storm.

“I want to tell you a story,” Yeshu said. “About a man. His name doesn’t matter. Maybe he’s dead. Maybe not. Maybe you’ve never heard of him. Maybe you know him well. I’ll call him Jaud. Don’t ask why — I don’t know myself.  
All his life, Jaud longed to be part of something — something greater, something bright. He wasn’t unhappy with himself, but a rot bloomed inside, like a tumor.  
He clung to ideals. A cause to serve. A god to worship. A monarch to obey. Every time he joined something, he found a crack in it. A flaw. And soon, he’d be alone again. That was his curse.  
He wrote. Some said he had a gift. But his writing only made things worse. Each line unsettled him. It brought no peace — only more confusion.  
One day he disappeared. Packed up and walked out. He wanted to find a whole to belong to — truly belong.  
He met a group. Their eyes burned with purpose. They had a leader — strange, but kind. Jaud pledged loyalty. And the leader moved cities with words. There were setbacks, stones thrown — but Jaud burned brighter with every blow. At last, he thought he found it.  
Then the leader met a woman. Took her in. Jaud was struck dumb by her. He blushed or snapped when he spoke to her. He knew it was over. She was the crack.  
He grew distant. But couldn’t stay away from her.  
One day, in a crowded city square, the leader spoke to a sea of faces — but his enemies were among them. And Jaud… slipped away. And told them where the leader was hiding.  
As he walked back, he whispered:  
‘I have no name. No flag. No god. I’ve spent my life searching, but found only ruins. People give themselves away like pocket change. But the whole is built from people — not the other way around.  
Yes. I’ve grasped what it means to betray.  
I am the man who dares stay himself.  
The man who drops his rifle and screams: I AM NOT YOUR BROTHER!  
SHOOT IF YOU MUST — I WON’T KNEEL!  
Yes. Only a coward dissolves into the crowd.  
Yes. I’m a traitor. The world will throw stones at me. But I will be myself.  
I’ll climb the highest mountain — and up there, alone, I may grow young again. Not by one year — by a thousand.  
The sun will blind me — I will keep walking.  
You gather to scream in megaphones. You line up in armies for glory. You kneel before your rotten gods.  
I remain alone. I thought I did it for the woman.  
But I did it for me.  
To stop chasing ghosts. To stop selling my smile.  
To be — myself. Because to be is stronger than to be heard…’  
When Jaud stepped over the threshold of the house where the leader was hiding, none of his comrades noticed the change in him.”  

Yeshu fell silent.  
We waited.  
Then he said:  
“If you’ll allow me… I won’t continue.”  
He raised his head and looked me straight in the eye. The old piercing gaze — but now with something else.  
Sorrow.  

“Well, as always,” Peter muttered.  
“What’s wrong, Teacher?” Jan asked.  
“I’m not in the mood,” Yeshu said.  
He nodded at Leo. “I’m worried about the future.”  
“What about it?”  
“The future…” he paused. “I’ll lose one of you. Or all of you. Or… one of you will take me from the rest.”

Jan and Yakov jumped to their feet. A knife flashed in Jan’s hand.  
Leo froze, pencil in the air.  
“Who is he?!” Jan roared.  
“Show him to me, Teacher!”  
“Easy, buddy,” Yeshu waved lazily.  
“Show me! So I can cut his heart out!”  
“You’re bloodthirsty,” Yeshu smiled.  
“But, Teacher! At least a hint…”  

Yeshu paused.  
“I don’t know yet,” he said. “Could be anyone.”  
A beat.  
Then he added:  
“For example… him.”  
Yeshu pointed at me.  
My throat clenched. Mary stirred — eyes on me, wide with unease. She didn’t know what it meant. But she felt it.  
And the room — for one second — tilted. Caught between prophecy and choice.  
In the hallway, Leo sketched like mad — trying to trap ghosts on paper.

###Chapter 8: [REDACTED]

That morning, apathy swallowed me whole. I dragged to the kitchen in slippers, avoiding everyone’s eyes. Everything grated on me.  
Grumpy Peter fried something and smoked.  
I waved the smoke away.  
“What?” he said.  
“Wrong side of the bed? Crawl back and try the other.”  
I didn’t answer. Just yanked the fridge open. Near empty.  
“Who ate everything?”  
Peter shrugged.  
Yeshu came in.  
“We gotta go or we’ll be late.”  
“Not going,” I muttered.  
“Why?”  
“Feel like shit.”  
“Final?”  
“Final.”  
“At least walk us to the car.”  
Outside — drizzle in the air.  
(resonate_again())  
Yeshu hunched his shoulders, fixed his beret, spat.  
“What are they doing up there?”  
“Depends who.”  
“Peter?”  
“Fresh stockings. Probably wondering if the boobs need more cotton.”  
“Thomas?”  
“Watching. Throwing barbs.”  
“Mary?”  
“Don’t know.”  
I turned away — though I knew damn well. She was still upstairs. Alone.  
“The fuck…” Yeshu said suddenly. “I left my book there…”  
“Grab it?”  
“Yeah, please…” Yeshu looked at me strange. “No, wait, Judas, leave it there.”  
He tapped my shoulder.  
“What’s with the face?”  
“Feel lousy.”  
I tried to veer off.  
“Teacher, personal question. Jews use a sheet with a hole, right?”  
“Sometimes. Why?”  
“Where’s the hole if it’s for rimming?”  
“Cut it in the underwear. Backside.”  
“But the sheet…”  
“No difference.” Yeshu laughed.  
“Gays breaking tradition, that’s all.”  
He got serious again.  
“So you’re really not coming?”  
“Really.”  
Just then — bang. The door. Peter — flawless in a new dress. Thomas behind him.  
“Mary’s not coming,” Peter sang.  
“She’s unwell,” Thomas smirked.  
Yeshu shot me a long look, then climbed into the car. They roared off.  
I went back in. My head spun: Mary — alone upstairs.  
I climbed.  
She lay curled in Yeshu’s bed, tear-tracks on her cheeks. Yeshu’s book lay open nearby. I took it.  
I sat beside Mary. Stroked her hair.  
“Sleep, Mary… Soon I’ll be gone.  
You won’t have to fear me.”  
Her eyes fluttered open.  
She gasped — I clamped her mouth.  
Tears welled.  
“I can’t change anything,” I whispered.  
“Nothing.”  
I let go.  
She sobbed, turned away. Comfort wasn’t my gift.  
I left, closing the door softly.  
Downstairs — the rain kicked in hard. Drumming a funeral march on the tin gutters.  
Soft. Relentless. Like the future, already closing in.  
But I knew that if self.stuck_in_loop():
                 final_strike()

###Chapter 9

I sat there, reading. Then — something felt off. Like the air had weight. I closed the book.  
Yeshu and the others wouldn’t be back soon. Mary was asleep.  
“What the fuck…”  
I felt eyes on me. Someone watching.  
I checked the house. All normal. Then — shimmer, ceiling, glitch. A breathless hum in the wires.  
I stepped closer.  
And then I saw you.  
Yeah… YOU.  
Who else?  
You’re reading, huh? On what — phone? Laptop?  
Or is it flipped? Who’s reading who?  
Maybe something’s slipping through the pixels, trying to pull you in — right out of your offline?  
No reply?  
Yeah… Thought so.  
I was shaking. Closed my eyes.  
Turned around, took the book, and walked away.  
For some reason, I remembered the line I read just before I shut it: “This page is not yours.”

###Chapter 10 [sudo rm -rf /binarity]

Mary flinched.  
She hadn’t caught every word Yeshu said — but she felt the charge in the air.  
Jan sprang up, knife already out.  
“If it’s Judas, I’ll cut him — God forgive me!”  
He lunged.  
I didn’t move.  
So be it, I thought… I even closed my eyes.  
And… nothing.  
Still alive.  
I opened them:  
Yeshu held Jan’s wrist in a steel grip. The blade hovered, useless.  
“No,” Yeshu said — calm, but loud.  
“Sit and breathe.”  
“Never!”  
“Sit! Now.”  
Something in his voice broke Jan’s fury. The giant sank into a chair, panting.  
“Kill…” he muttered.  
“Kill…”  
“Whom will you kill?”  
“Judas…”  
“Why?”  
“You said…”  
“Did I say Judas betrayed me?”  
Yeshu scanned the circle.  
“I said anyone could. Say — Judas.  
So, for now, he is not a traitor.”  
For now.  
The phrase iced my spine. No one else seemed to notice.  
Peter, regaining his smirk:  
“Told Jan to take sedatives. That berserker act is passé.”  
“Not just passé,” Thomas added.  
“Ridiculous.”  
Jan hunched, shamed.  
The talk drifted.  
No one stared at me now — except Mary.  
Only Mary.  
She watched, unblinking. You don’t buy this peace, do you, Mary? You feel the tear long before it rips.  
You don’t know why I’ll do it — I barely know myself. They’ll call it jealousy, or thirty silver.  
They’ll boil it for bedtime.  
Traitor.  
That word curls in my skull like a worm. But I’ve seen its true face: the one who dares to walk alone. Who won’t merge. Who says mine in the face of void.  
Yeshu understands. Too well.  
That’s why he stopped the parable.  
That’s why he watches me now — not with anger, but with quiet recognition.  
You beg for peace, Mary.  
I crave rupture.  
Oil and water.  
Yeshu lifts his cup.  
“One more thing. Don’t take my story literally.”  
“Huh?” Peter blinks.  
“In Aramaic, simpleton: don’t read it like scripture.”  
Peter shrugs. Bored already.  
I look at their faces: Thomas sneering. Peter preening. Jan broken. Yakov clenched. Andrew — lost. Leo sketching ghosts.  
And Mary… Mary, trying to hold the cosmos together with nothing but a frightened heartbeat.  
Too late.  
The screws are turning.  
The wheel will crush Yeshu, exalt him, and paint me black.  
So be it. Someone has to keep the balance honest.  
I raise my glass. Not to toast — just to wet a dry mouth.  
Yeshu meets my eyes.  
No hatred. Only sorrow. And — bleak gratitude.  
He sips. I sip. The others chatter.  
Outside, the rain returns.  
Steady.  
Insistent.  
As if washing the city for what’s coming next.

###Chapter 11: RESONATE_AGAIN

The next morning, following my betrayal, Yeshu was arrested.  
Imperial guards burst through the apartment, cursing and laughing like jackals.  
Yeshu sat at the kitchen table — iron shackles on his wrists.  
Two guards stood behind him, grinning.  
The moment Jan saw this, he went berserk.  
He lunged at me first — fury burning in his face — but then, suddenly remembering himself, he spat:  
“With you, you son of a bitch, I’ll deal later!”  
And threw himself at the guards.  
A brawl erupted.  
Peter barely managed two steps — he got tangled in the folds of his robe and crashed to the floor like a felled tree.  
Thomas, out of nowhere, burst into hysterical laughter.  
He laughed and laughed, like a madman, clutching his stomach, unable to stop.  
Rolling on the floor, he shouted:  
“I don’t believe it… I don’t believe this is happening… It can’t be this simple… I don’t believe it… I don’t believe…!”  
One of the guards swung his sword, and noble Jan fell to his knees.  
I saw something roll across the floor.  
Looking closer, I realized it was his severed ear.  
In helplessness, Jan wept and dropped his sword.  
Through it all Yeshu stayed silent, eyes fixed on me. Not reproach — never reproach — only that same fathomless sadness. Over the din I caught the hush of his voice, meant for me alone:  
“Lilit, take my hand. Lilit, we begin a new chapter in the history of mankind. Then chapter turns.”  
My stomach lurched, but my feet stayed planted. I watched them drag him out, chains clinking, coat half-off one shoulder.  
Guards kicked bedroom doors at random. Behind the last one Mary still slept, breath slow and even. The officer glanced in, saw only a girl curled beneath a blanket, and waved his men on. They shut the door gently — almost respectfully — and left her to dream.  
When the flat emptied, smoke from broken lamps drifted in lazy coils.  
I lit a cigarette with shaking hands. The ember flared, tiny and defiant in the wreckage.  
Outside, dawn bled into the alleys. Somewhere ahead, a hill, a crossbeam, a crowd already sharpening its cheers. History grinding into place — hungry for martyrs and for monsters.  
I exhaled. Rain hissed on the window bars.  
(resonate_again())  
For the first time the name Judas tasted like iron in my mouth — bitter, but wholly mine.
